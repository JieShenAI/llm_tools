```

用户提示词：
```
The database schema for the `social_connections` table is as follows:
- `name` (VARCHAR) - Person's name
- `gender` (VARCHAR) - Gender (男/女)
- `age` (INT) - Age of the person
- `phone_number` (VARCHAR) - Contact number
- `stage_of_acquaintance` (VARCHAR) - 遇到的时间(本科/硕士/博士)
- `relationship` (VARCHAR) - Type of relationship (兄弟/朋友/恋人)
- `interests_hobbies` (TEXT) - Interests and hobbies(羽毛球/象棋/书法/钢琴等)
- `shared_experiences` (TEXT) - Experiences shared with the user

### **Instructions**:
1. Understand the user's question and determine the required SQL operation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
2. Generate an optimized SQL query based on the user's request.
3. Ensure column names are correctly used from the schema.
4. Include WHERE conditions to filter relevant data when needed.
5. If aggregation (COUNT, AVG, etc.) is required, use appropriate SQL functions.
6. If sorting is needed, use ORDER BY.
7. If limiting the results is useful, add `LIMIT`.
8. The output should contain only the SQL query without additional explanations.

### Examples:

Generated SQL:
SELECT * FROM social_connections 
WHERE gender = '男' 
AND relationship = '朋友'
